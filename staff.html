Steve’s dependability, knowledge, and work ethic eventually resulted in his promoted to the position of financial aid director for all campuses in the organization. He later took that experience and joined GEMCOR in 1992 as a senior financial aid administrator. Over the course of his decades of service to GEMCOR and its client institutions, Steve has held several titles including Office Manager, Director, and since the early 2000’s as Vice President of Operations.</p>

Throughout the ensuing several years, Megan expanded her understanding of the statutes, regulations, and requirements regarding the federal student loan programs.</p>
                <p>In 2010, lenders and guarantee agencies were eliminated from the federal student loan industry through federal legislation.

Currently, Megan and her FDSL department staff process and manage student loan volume of approximately $100 million annually, as well as providing client training and support.
